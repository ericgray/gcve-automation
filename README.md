# Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) Automation Examples

Scripts and examples to automate Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) administration with PowerCLI.

## Overview

These are example scripts that demonstrate how to get started with various GCVE automation tasks. This is provided for convenience and not supported by VMware or Google Cloud. You must review, and potentially adjust the contents, before attempting to use in your own environment.

## Key Capabilities

These modules include commands for seting up authenticated connections and creating key network components.

| Command               | Purpose                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connect-NsxServerGcve | Run Connect-NsxServer with credentials pulled from Google Cloud  |
| Connect-VIServerGcve  | Run Connect-VIServer with credentials pulled from Google Cloud   |
| Get-GcveFqdn          | Get FQDN for VMware vCenter and VMware NSX management interfaces |
| New-DhcpServer        | Create new VMware NSX DHCP server object                         |
| Set-DhcpServerOnTier1 | Attach a DHCP server to a Tier-1 router                          |
| New-Segment           | Create new VMware NSX segment for VMs                            |

For a full list of commands:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module GcveAuthentication
Get-Command -Module GcveNetworkAutomation
```

## Prerequisites

The authentication module leverages the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to authenticate with Google Cloud. This provides for seamless access to your GCVE private cloud management credentials for VMware vCenter and VMware NSX. Ensure gcloud is properly [initialized](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) with your credentials as well as project ID and GCP zone where your private cloud is deployed. For example:

```bash
gcloud config set core/project <project ID>
gcloud config set compute/zone <GCVE zone>
```

If you prefer not to set up `gcloud` you can ignore the `GcveAuthentication.psm1` module and simply use the standard PowerCLI `Connect-NsxServer` cmdlet.

The PowerShell scripts require VMware PowerCLI, which is a module that can be downloaded automatically, the following commands will get you started:

```powershell
Set-PSRepository -Name "PSGallery" -InstallationPolicy Trusted
Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI
```

On Windows, PowerShell [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3) may block these samples. To quickly change the policy, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine -Force
```

These samples were developed using PowerShell 7.3.1 and PowerCLI 12.7, 13.0

To learn more, see the [PowerCLI documentation](https://developer.vmware.com/powercli).

## Examples

```powershell
# Import the modules, connect to vCenter using GCVE credentials:
Import-Module ./GcveNetworkAutomation.psm1,./GcveAuthentication.psm1 -Force
Connect-VIServerGcve -PrivateCloud orange

# Then, use PowerCLI cmdlets as usual with vCenter on GCVE:
Get-VM
Get-Datacenter

# Set up an NSX network segment for VMs after initial
# GCVE private cloud deployment (with or without DHCP)
Connect-NsxServerGcve -PrivateCloud orange

New-DhcpServer -Name dhcp0
Set-DhcpServerOnTier1 -Name dhcp0

New-Segment -Name workload8810 -GatewayAddress 10.88.10.1/24 `
    -DhcpRange 10.88.10.100-10.88.10.200 `
    -DnsServers 10.88.8.34,10.88.8.35

New-Segment -Name workload8811 -GatewayAddress 10.88.11.1/24
```
